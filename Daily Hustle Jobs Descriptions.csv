,"Pricing Guidelines:
- Worker Reward = Task complexity × Time × Market demand.
- Employer Budget = Worker reward + ~20–30% platform/service fee + margin for quality verification.
- High-effort tasks like UGC or Viral TikTok require significantly higher budgets.
- Quick microtasks (likes, follows, votes) can have minimal reward but high repetition potential.",,,,,,,,,
